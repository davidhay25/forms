<h4>ACT-NOW</h4>

ACT-NOW (Anti-Cancer Therapies – Nationally Organised Workstreams) is developing a national systemic anti-cancer therapy (SACT) data collection and analytics programme. This will capture the detailed structured data that sits within frontline electronic systems that plan and deliver SACT, and work with stakeholders to measure things that will support improvements to treatment access, quality, consistency, and efficiency.
<br/><br/>
National data on treatment equity, consistency, quality and efficiency of SACT is sparse, and this is a barrier to making evidence driven improvements to equity and quality of care for people with cancer. ACT-NOW will address these key gaps in national data to better inform targeted and data-driven quality improvement activities within the SACT system.

    <div uib-accordion-group class="panel-default" heading="Introducing the ACT-NOW data standard ">

        The ACT-NOW data standard identifies and describes the data elements that should be captured from provider electronic systems and submitted into a national collection when prescribing and treating people living with cancer using systemic anti-cancer therapies. SACT refers to all anti-cancer drug treatments. This includes chemotherapy, targeted therapies, hormones and other drug therapies.
        <br/><br/>
        We have visualised the data standard using our interactive form format and layout to aid review, feedback and implementation planning.
        A formal HISO word document will also be published when finalised.

<h4>Systemic Anti-Cancer Therapies</h4>
<br/>
Identify and describe the data elements that should be captured from provider electronic
systems and submitted into a national collection when prescribing and treating people living
with cancer using systemic anti-cancer therapy (SACT). SACT refers to all anti-cancer drug
treatments. This includes chemotherapy, targeted therapies, hormones and other drug
therapies.
<br/> <br/>
The ACT-NOW Data Standard has been developed with an expected release in the first
quarter of 2022/2023.
