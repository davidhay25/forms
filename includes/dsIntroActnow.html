<h4>Site navigation</h4>
Here are some helpful pointers to get you started navigating our site:
<ul>
    <li>In the top left-hand corner “select standard to view” enables you to search for standards.
    <li>Click the standard you want to view. Each Standard defaults to the Form view.
    <li>Click on the name of each Form section to view the data fields corresponding to that section.
    <li>Hover over <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"></i> and <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down"></i> icons above a data field to get some guidance on field definition and rules for use.
    <li>Use the feedback boxes (called reviewer comments) at the end of each Form section to note any issues or provide feedback (e.g., missing fields, incorrect definitions or values, fields that should be included or general comments).  These feedback boxes be used during development and when a standard is published.
    <li>Some fields will not appear until you choose a relevant value in a previous field (e.g., clinical TNM triggers additional fields to appear). Free text boxes will appear when the value “Other” is selected.
    <li>If you are providing feedback you must enter in your details in the “Reviewer details” box. Once you populate your name and write a comment in a reviewer box a Submit button will appear. Please only submit when finished.
    <li>The <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-home"></i>  icon at the top of the page that appears when a standard is being viewed will allow you to return to the front page.
