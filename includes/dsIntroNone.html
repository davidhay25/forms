<h4>Te Aho o Te Kahu, Cancer Control Agency Data Standards Manager</h4>
<br/><br/>
Nationally agreed and Health Information Standards Organisation (HISO) endorsed data
standards help facilitate the timely sharing of cancer data and information for decision
making, improvement and research.
<br/><br/>
Te Aho o Te Kahu is working with a range of clinical specialities to transition to an
interoperable digital health environment through the development and subsequent national
adoption of data standards over the coming years.
<br/><br/>
Health Information Standard Organisation (HISO) published standards set requirements for
the safe, secure and purposeful use and sharing of health information. Standards ensure the
integrity of health information and that systems are interoperable. They are part of an
ecosystem in which patients and consumers and their family/whānau have access to and
control over their own information.
<br/><br/>
Te Whatu Ora has developed an Interoperability Roadmap to support a modern, digitally
enabled and data-driven health and disability system to improve equity and pae ora (healthy
futures). An interoperable digital health ecosystem relies on the national adoption of data
standards and collaboration across the health sector.
<br/><br/>
The current focus in 2022 is Structured Pathology, Multidisciplinary meetings (MDM) and
Anti-Systemic Therapies. For more information on standards development in these areas
please choose from the following areas. Over time more standards will be developed to
provide a comprehensive library across the entire cancer continuum.
