<h4>Te Aho o Te Kahu, Cancer Control Agency Data Standards Manager</h4>

<br/>
<h4>Welcome to Te Aho o Te Kahu website for data standards in Aotearoa New Zealand.</h4>
<br/>

Te Aho o Te Kahu is fully committed to working in partnership with the sector to enable the collection of complete and accurate cancer data, join currently disparate data siloes, and to provide a means to share timely clinical cancer information throughout the health care system to support clinical care and patient/whānau needs.
<br/></br>


This website outlines Te Aho o Te Kahu commitment to develop, publish, and maintain cancer data standards to facilitate the timely sharing of cancer data and information.
<br/></br>
We are currently working with the sector to support:
<ul>
    <li>Medical oncology and haematology as part of the ACT-NOW programme of work.
    <li>Structured Pathology.
    <li>Multidisciplinary meetings (MDM).
    <li>Radiation Oncology.

</ul>

We will develop data standards for all treatment modalities and specialities over the coming years.
<br/></br>
Our data standards are visualised in an interactive Form that follows a generic clinical workflow to aid data review and understanding. They are not an implementation form.

        CanShare is a national health informatics platform that will allow the timely sharing of relevant and accurate cancer data.
        <br/> <br/>
        Based on the  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.health.govt.nz/nz-health-statistics/classification-and-terminology/new-zealand-snomed-ct-national-release-centre/snomed-ct">SNOMED CT</a> medical terminology,

        <br/> <br/>
        Outcomes from this work will include advanced analytics capability and supporting up-to-date monitoring of cancer care throughout the motu.
        <br/> <br/>
        Please visit our  <a href="https://teaho.govt.nz/reports/canshare" target="_blank">CanShare website</a> to find out more on this important mahi.
        <br/> <br/>
        We want to acknowledge the invaluable contributions from health care practitioners, equity and technical experts from across the motu who are supporting this mahi.

    <div uib-accordion-group class="panel-default" heading="Purpose of this site">

        A fundamental aspect of Canshare is the development and implementation of national data standards. Our data standards identify and describe clinically relevant data elements to aid the implementation in data capture workflows in your systems and processes.
        <br/> <br/>
        This website provides guidance for anyone looking to:
        <ul>
            <li>provide feedback on data standards that are published or are in development. This can be done at any time to ensure the standards stay relevant for use in clinical practice in Aotearoa.
            <li>use cancer specific data standards, with guidance in reviewing, building and/or updating data systems and associated clinical workflows.
            <li>use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.health.govt.nz/nz-health-statistics/classification-and-terminology/new-zealand-snomed-ct-national-release-centre/snomed-ct">SNOMED CT</a>  for clinical terminology with <a target="_blank" href = "https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/digital-health/digital-health-sector-architecture-standards-and-governance/health-information-standards/new-zealand-fhir-registry">FHIR</a> standards.
            <li>support broader work to improve the shareability of cancer information.
            <li>view the latest information on data standard development and release status.

        Nationally agreed and Health Information Standards Organisation (HISO) endorsed data standards help facilitate the timely sharing of cancer data and information for decision making, improvement and research.
        <br/> <br/>
        Te Aho o Te Kahu is working with a range of clinical specialities to transition to an interoperable digital health environment through the development and subsequent national adoption of data standards over the coming years.
        <br/> <br/>
        Health Information Standard Organisation (HISO) published standards set requirements for the safe, secure and purposeful use and sharing of health information. Standards ensure the integrity of health information and that systems are interoperable. They are part of an ecosystem in which patients and consumers and their family/whānau have access to and control over their own information.
        <br/> <br/>
        Te Whatu Ora has developed an Interoperability Roadmap to support a modern, digitally enabled and data-driven health and disability system to improve equity and pae ora (healthy futures). An interoperable digital health ecosystem relies on the national adoption of data standards and collaboration across the health sector.
        <br/> <br/>
        Full implementation of our cancer standards in a production system would only be practical if much of the data is automatically populated via patient and clinical systems. This would minimise the administrative burden on clinicians and others involved in data entry.
        <br/> <br/>
        It is not expected that all the data elements included can be collected immediately and/or are clinically required. This includes balancing structured data capture and free text for more nuanced narrative reporting.

        <strong>Background</strong>
        <br/><br/>
    Te Aho o Te Kahu is committed to improving cancer care and making a meaningful
    difference to all New Zealanders affected by cancer. We are equity led, whānau centred,
    knowledge-driven and outcomes focused.
        <br/><br/>
    As part of our commitment to fewer cancers, better survival and equity for all, our work
    involves researching and analysing data and information to inform and implement best
    practice. This includes being the leading source of information on cancer control for
    people with cancer and their whānau, health care professionals and anyone involved in
    cancer care.
        <br/><br/>
    With this responsibility comes the privilege of accessing people’s cancer data. To that end
    we are committed to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place to:
        <ul>
            <li>ensure all cancer information is used appropriately for the purpose for which it
                was intended.</li>
            <li>give effect to Te Tiriti o Waitangi by treating data as a taonga (treasure) to secure
                and protect Māori data from misuse. Te Aho o Te Kahu recognises the rights and
                interests of Māori in the collection, ownership, and application of data.</li>
        </ul>

        <br/>
    This commitment is fundamental to driving equity focused decisions, better inform the
    measurement of outcomes, and to ensure Māori have the information they need to
    exercise their tino rangatiratanga.
        <br/><br/>
        <strong>Our response</strong>
        <br/><br/>
    We are actively working with our partners to better understand and put into practice our
    obligations and responsibilities for data standard development. Te Aka Whai Ora in
    partnership with Manatū Hauora and Te Whatu Ora are preparing to release guidance to
    support implementation of Māori Data Sovereignty. This will provide fundamental
    guidance in the development and implementation of data standards going forward.
        <br/><br/>
    We are in the early stages of this life-long journey. We are all in this together so
    opportunity to learn, share and gain confidence together.

    <div uib-accordion-group class="panel-default" heading="Developing standards">

        In general, the following key points relate to all our standards.
        <br/> <br/>
        <ol>
        <li>The data standards developed are based on recognised clinically applicable protocols/guideless.
        <li>A working group is formed, led by a range of health care practitioners, supported by equity and technical subject matter experts.
        <li>All data standards are submitted to HISO for endorsement once approved by the working group that developed them.
            <li>The data standards are visualised using a familiar format and layout with interactive fields to <strong>aid data field review only. It is not an implementation form.</strong>
        <li>It is not expected that all the data elements included can be collected immediately and/or are clinically required. They are included for completeness.
        <li>Data should be entered once with the sharing/reusing of data across multiple systems. Implementation in a production system should only be practical if much of the data is automatically populated via patient and clinical systems to minimise the administrative burden on clinicians and others involved in data entry.
            <li>Some sections <strong>patient details</strong>( e.g. NHI etc) and <strong>Administration</strong> (e.g. requesting health care practitioner etc) are there for <strong>demonstration</strong> purposes only rather than as a requirement for how these data fields should be implemented.
        <li>The data standards will be continuously monitored and updated according to international best practice, sector feedback and evolving local requirements.
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div uib-accordion-group class="panel-default" heading="Types of standards">
        There are four categories of standard development:

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Development:</strong> a standard that is been developed by the working group, so your feedback is requested in preparation for submission to HISO for approval.
        <li><strong>Working draft dataset:</strong>  a dataset that is not considered sufficiently robust since it has not been recently updated by international processes and/or insufficient clinical support available to develop.
        <li><strong>Draft data standard:</strong>  a HISO endorsed draft data standard that has been developed from recognised protocols by subject matter experts/clinical representatives. The draft data standard is considered sufficient for piloting in a system but does require wider sector review through feedback and/or use in services over a period of up to 12 months.
        <li><strong>Data standard:</strong>  a HISO endorsed finalised data standard where changes have been applied from release period  feedback with health care practitioners and subject matter experts, confirming it is fit for purpose for implementation in a production system.
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div uib-accordion-group class="panel-default" heading="Site navigation and feedback">
        Here are some helpful pointers to get you started navigating our site:
        <ul>
            <li>In the top left-hand corner “select standard to view” enables you to search for standards.
            <li>Click the standard you want to view. Each Standard defaults to the Form view.
            <li>Click on the name of each Form section to view the data fields corresponding to that section.
            <li>Hover over <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"></i> and <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down"></i> icons above a data field to get some guidance on field definition and rules for use.
            <li>Use the feedback boxes (called reviewer comments) at the end of each Form section to note any issues or provide feedback (e.g., missing fields, incorrect definitions or values, fields that should be included or general comments).  These feedback boxes be used during development and when a standard is published.
            <li>Some fields will not appear until you choose a relevant value in a previous field (e.g., clinical TNM triggers additional fields to appear). Free text boxes will appear when the value “Other” is selected.
            <li>If you are providing feedback you must enter in your details in the “Reviewer details” box. Once you populate your name and write a comment in a reviewer box a Submit button will appear. Please only submit when finished.
            <li>The <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-home"></i>  icon at the top of the page that appears when a standard is being viewed will allow you to return to the front page.
        </ul>
