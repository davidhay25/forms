<h4>Multidisciplinary Meeting (MDMs)</h4>
<br/>

A cancer multidisciplinary meeting (MDM) is a regular meeting where health professionals from different specialities discuss and recommend options for a patient's treatment and care.
<br/><br/>
Access to high-quality patient information is vital for informed decision-making during the MDM process.

        Consistent and reliable data enables MDM attendees to agree on clinical recommendations for the treatment pathway that best meets the individual needs of a patient. This is particularly important for Māori and Pacific peoples who experience poorer access, timeliness and quality of health care, contributing to avoidable and unfair differences in cancer outcomes.
        <br/><br/>
        We have visualised the data standards in an interactive form format and layout to aid review, feedback and implementation planning. A formal HISO word document will also be published when finalised.

A cancer multidisciplinary meeting (MDM) is a regular meeting where health professionals

Access to high-quality patient information is vital for informed decision-making during the

patient. This is particularly important for Māori and Pacific who experience poorer access,
timeliness and quality of health care, contributing to avoidable and unfair differences in
cancer outcomes.

The first Multidisciplinary Meeting (MDM) Data Standard review has started in partnership
with the sector with an expected release in the second quarter of 2022/2023.
