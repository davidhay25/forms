        This is the front page for the FHIR artifacts and applications developed to support the CanShare programme of work.

        It is not intended as the 'front facing' url for the programme - it is anticipated that there will be links from
        existing websites (eg the <a href="https://teaho.govt.nz/">Te Aho</a> web sites to the specific modules which are
        described below. Rather, this page serves as an index for members of the project team to the different artifacts.

        <h3>Modules</h3>

                <td>General access by Clinicians, Implementers and business users</td>
                <td>There are 3 sets of standard available from this module:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Working draft dataset:</strong> A dataset that is not considered sufficiently robust since it has not been recently updated by international processes and/or insufficient clinical support available to develop</li>
                        <li><strong>Draft data standard:</strong> A data standard that has been developed from adapting a recently updated ICCR/RCPA protocol by subject matter experts/clinical representatives. The draft data standard is considered sufficient but requires wider sector review through feedback and/or use in pathology services over a period of up to 12 months.</li>
                        <li><strong>Data standard:</strong> Changes have been applied to the draft data standard from feedback through the release period and the subject matter experts/clinical representatives feel that it is fit for purpose.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Has functions to display each standard in a number of different renderings, including a sample form. Also allows comments
                    to be made by users, which are included as elements within the form.
