http://canshare.com/fhir/Questionnaire/mdmdatastandard	reviewercomments1	Reviewer comments	Patient Summary	Pennie Symmans  Middlemore Hospital	Is this MDM summary intended to be a living document which gets added to as the patient has initial treatment, maybe has a recurrence, has different treatment, maybe a metastasis with further surgery etc? Some MDMs are a one-off where patients are not often rediscussed (eg Breast), some are full of patients who are regularly re-discussed (eg Sarcoma). I don't quite see how this form works smoothly for the latter. eg why would you need to re-enter previous treatment history if the previous treatment was also recommended by the MDM? It seems a clumsy document for more complex MDMs.
http://canshare.com/fhir/Questionnaire/mdmdatastandard	reviewercomments3	Reviewer comments	MDM meeting details	Pennie Symmans  Middlemore Hospital	The MDM is attended by core members who generally stay for the entire meeting or for designated sections of the meeting, with a group of non-core members who may attend for just one case. The MDMs I attend last for 90 to >180 minutes. I don't know how we are meant to accurately capture this attendee data, it seems very impractical. We already struggle to get through the cases, so anything which makes the MDM more cumbersome is not welcome.

http://canshare.com/fhir/Questionnaire/mdmdatastandard	reviewercomments1	Reviewer comments	Patient Summary	Clinton Lewis  Auckland City Hospital	Is this the appropriate place for psychosocial/non-clinical supports to be addressed? It doesn't seem like a focus area of a MDM (at least as they are managed in haematology). Additionally, comorbidities should be multi-select with the option to add additional detail where appropriate. Ideally should pull through from other EHR tools (e.g. problem lists) so important to have comorbidities structured as ?disorders from a SNOMED perspective.
http://canshare.com/fhir/Questionnaire/mdmdatastandard	reviewerfeedback1	Reviewer comments	Radiology review	Clinton Lewis  Auckland City Hospital	I'm not sure that this is going to be quite granular enough or provide enough detail - do the dates and details of imaging need to be included in this scan to document what was actually reviewed?
http://canshare.com/fhir/Questionnaire/mdmdatastandard	reviewerfeedback	Reviewer comments	Pathology review	Clinton Lewis  Auckland City Hospital	This isn't going to be sufficient for haematology - having a single block of text will not capture cytogenetic, molecular, flow cytometric, histologic, and cytologic parameters adequately. Additionally, there is no space for additional important details such as prognostic markers (e.g. LDH in lymphoma), number of sites involved, etc.  Furthermore the staging section makes no allowance for non-medical oncology staging which is important and disease/histology specific in haematology (and some medical oncology diagnoses).
http://canshare.com/fhir/Questionnaire/mdmdatastandard	reviewercomments4	Reviewer comments	MDM discussion and recommendations	Clinton Lewis  Auckland City Hospital	Grading of histology is only partially relevant to haematology. It is a very med onc specific feature.   The national data specification included additional terms for treatment intent for haematology after national consultation.   Having a discussion + recommendations sections separately is likely to be redundant and could probably be combined.

http://canshare.com/fhir/Questionnaire/mdmdatastandard	reviewercomments	Reviewer comments	Referrer	Jo Anson  Te Aho o Te Kahu	Item 6; Currently there are no requirements for clinicians to refer patients to the MDM purely for data collection purposes. I'm working on a memo with Gabrielle to potentially move NZ to a model of only discussing complex patients and registering the rest but this has yet to be agreed. Good that the function is in here for future use however we also need to consider what a minimum dataset might look like for patients that are only registered ie some of the current mandatory fields may not be appropriate

"Referrer name" The clinician requesting MDM discussion may not be the same as the clinician referring the patient for management eg respiratory physician requests radiation oncology FSA. Radiation oncologist requests MDM discussion with or without having seen patient. "Source of Referral" is this intended to be clinician or specialty or facility or district or region or domicile? "Other investigations required" is this to be completed before or after the MDM discussion. If before who would arrange the investigation and how would completion be signalled to trigger MDM discussion. Would MDM be delayed until investigation completed?

http://canshare.com/fhir/Questionnaire/mdmdatastandard	reviewerfeedback1	Reviewer comments	Radiology review	David Hamilton  Te Whatu Ora Capital, Coast and Hutt Vallet	"Radiology concordance" I assume this is intended to mean concordance with previously issued radiology report.

http://canshare.com/fhir/Questionnaire/mdmdatastandard	reviewerfeedback	Reviewer comments	Pathology review	David Hamilton  Te Whatu Ora Capital, Coast and Hutt Vallet	Should pathology also have a "concordance" field? In practice pathology may often be "reviewed" at MDM when an initial report has not been issued. This review is then used as basis for diagnosis and decisions on management.
http://canshare.com/fhir/Questionnaire/mdmdatastandard	reviewercomments4	Reviewer comments	MDM discussion and recommendations	David Hamilton  Te Whatu Ora Capital, Coast and Hutt Vallet	Staging: No comment box for staging! Not all staging is TNM based eg CNS tumours, gynae (FIGO). TNM stage needs to be related to edition of TNM being used. "Diagnosis" may be multiple with synchronous different tumours "Date of Diagnosis" It needs to be clear if this is the first date of diagnosis eg based on examination findings, CXR or other imaging or serology eg PSA, or date of histologically confirmed diagnosis (if available). There may be weeks between the different diagnosis dates. Final diagnosis may be made without any pathology on occasion eg lung, brain, pancreas. Basis of diagnosis should be highest level basis at a given time point. "Care plan intent" Needs additional options eg Surveillance, follow-up, indeterminate "Care plan intent" needs to record differing opinions if these exist eg "pt should have surgery v. pt should have RT. "MDM Actions" It would be highly desirable to execute actions from the MDM document eg referral to medical oncology; referral to palliative care etc rather than have to rely on these actions being taken subsequent to the meeting
http://canshare.com/fhir/Questionnaire/mdmdatastandard	reviewercomments5	Reviewer comments	MDM administration	David Hamilton  Te Whatu Ora Capital, Coast and Hutt Vallet	By definition if pt has been discussed at MDM how have they been declined. Definition should be referred for discussion and declined. This needs to have a response to referrer for basis of decline eg "more staging info needed", "no point in discussion - treatment pathway well defined" etc "MDM record status" is this deferred discussion ie did not happen, or deferred decision bring back to another meeting "Date record created" Is this the date of MDM discussion or date referral for discussion at MDM was made?
http://canshare.com/fhir/Questionnaire/mdmdatastandard	reviewercomments3	Reviewer comments	MDM meeting details	David Hamilton  Te Whatu Ora Capital, Coast and Hutt Vallet	"MDM facility name"  Hospital, District or Region?

http://canshare.com/fhir/Questionnaire/mdmdatastandard	reviewercomments1	Reviewer comments	Patient Summary	Robert Weinkove  Te Whatu Ora Health New Zealand, Capital, Coast and Hutt Valley	There are too many checkboxes in the patient comorbidities list - the list needs to be pared down to 8 or fewer. For example, asthma and COPD should be combined; as should the various vascular comorbidites (CHF, CVA, IHD, PVD). There is absolutely no point in having cancer in the comorbidities list, as it will be ticked inconsistently (does it mean a prior separate cancer, or the cancer the patient is referred to this MDM for)? Finally, all the abbreviations must be defined - I do not know what CVD refers to in this context. Item 4, Site of interest, requires a N/A option, as for many malignancies (including most haematological ones) there is no specific site of interest Items 11, 12 and 13 are redundant - replace with a single box stating, "Additional relevant information (patient preferences, psychosocial factors, support services)"
http://canshare.com/fhir/Questionnaire/mdmdatastandard	reviewercomments4	Reviewer comments	MDM discussion and recommendations	Robert Weinkove  Te Whatu Ora Health New Zealand Capital Coast and Hutt Valley	Basis of diagnosis, is an unnecessary field. The diagnosis is always made on the basis of the clinicopathological information presented at the MDM. Unclear why histological tumour type and histopathological grade are specific fields here, but not other relevant pathology, e.g. molecular testing. For many haematological malignancies (e.g. most leukaemias, most myeloproliferative neoplasms), there is often no histology or histological grading involved - instead, diagnosis is based on other modalities (genetic or molecular testing, cytology and/or flow cytometry), for which no boxes are provided. It is unclear where the treatment plan, which is the most important part of the MDM document for clinicians, is meant to be documented. Should the treatment plan be recorded under 'discussion summary' or under 'MDM Actions'. Also, why does 'care plan intent' warrant a box, when there is no specific box that details what the 'care plan' is?

http://canshare.com/fhir/Questionnaire/mdmdatastandard	reviewercomments4	Reviewer comments	MDM discussion and recommendations	Gordon Allen  Gynaecology Oncology Service, Wellington Hospital	This is likely an internal IT process issue, but bears some degree of concern.   From my experience, in the past when MDM Clinical Documents were distributed to a patients GP, on occasion these documents were immediately uploaded to a patients private medical/clinical portal. In the past some patients have received/reviewed these clinical documents; that include confirmation of a cancer diagnosis, before the treating service/tumour stream service representative has contacted the patient to discuss MDM outcomes/confirmed diagnosis. This has caused considerable distress to the affected patient/s and the treating/involved service.   Should a field be included to identify if a patient has/has not been informed of the confirmed (cancer) diagnosis or other sensitive information contained within the MDM Documentation. Where this field would sit would need to be clearly identifiable/obvious to the receiving GP/Primary carer.

Is an MDM form still required to be completed to capture the declined MDM Referral. How are the mandatory fields completed if the patient isn't actually reviewed because the MDM Referral has been declined.        If a patient is deferred, is the prepared MDM document (with all mandatory fields) still required to be completed or does the prepared MDM document "roll over" to the following meeting? if not 'rolled over" is an second/another MDM document required for the next meeting; where MDM booking has been deferred too?.

It would be so much easier to have a number on a card to add to this data. Just a thought.
http://canshare.com/fhir/Questionnaire/mdmdatastandard	reviewercomments	Reviewer comments	Referrer	Diana Ayling  Head and Neck Cancer Support Network	I think there needs to be more information here. Patients report being traumatised from attending MDM. There needs to be some information about the patient and whānau needs at the MDM. Another key issue is that patients report they did not receive good communication, sufficient information about their situation and options, many report not enough information on which to make an informed choise. Post MDM patient meetings are often rushed and insufficient time provided for the patient and their whānau to consider their options and make the best choices. Is there any information gathered at this point about whether the patient has come from a private specialist? Is there any information provided patient intentions regarding private surgical treatment?
http://canshare.com/fhir/Questionnaire/mdmdatastandard	reviewercomments1	Reviewer comments	Patient Summary	Diana Ayling  Head and Neck Cancer Support Network	See previous comments. Something needs to be gathered about private treatment options.
http://canshare.com/fhir/Questionnaire/mdmdatastandard	reviewercomments2	reviewer comments	Previous MDM details	Diana Ayling  Head and Neck Cancer Support Network	if there is a previous record, does the patient have a copy? If not then one should be provided at this point.  Often their have been follow up discussions about the patient which the patient is not informed. This needs to be made clear at this point.
http://canshare.com/fhir/Questionnaire/mdmdatastandard	reviewercomments4	Reviewer comments	MDM discussion and recommendations	Diana Ayling  Head and Neck Cancer Support Network	There is a bit of work do to here, due to the tendency of MDMs to promote singular pathways. A full range of options need to be considered.
http://canshare.com/fhir/Questionnaire/mdmdatastandard	reviewercomments5	Reviewer comments	MDM administration	Diana Ayling  Head and Neck Cancer Support Network	Great to have the opportunity to record modifications, but you need to have a record of the modifications and who made them.
http://canshare.com/fhir/Questionnaire/mdmdatastandard	reviewercomments3	Reviewer comments	MDM meeting details	Diana Ayling  Head and Neck Cancer Support Network	Can there be something here about who was delegated to communicate to the patient and their role in the organisation. Too much of this work ends up in the hands of the wrong people because specialists are dividing their time between private and public practice.

Item 5 - this should autopopulate the options available from the selection you have made in 1 so you can't chose a date and time that doesn't have the MDM.

http://canshare.com/fhir/Questionnaire/mdmdatastandard	reviewercomments1	Reviewer comments	Patient Summary	Johnson  Wellington Hospital, Ccdhb	co-morbidities - cancer  - what does this mean or tell you? you then ask for additional personal history of cancer - what does this add?  a lot of this will not be known or appreciated until after the MDM management plan that is dependent on review of radiology and pathology and not known to the final service family history of cancer is too vague - most families have someone with a cancer - is this meant to be family known to carry a genetic mutation?

Not sure what the definition of ethnicity. I do not see Maori or Pasifika, just a lot of european countries. I also do not see and African or Black category. Also what is the difference between British nec and British nfd?
http://canshare.com/fhir/Questionnaire/mdmdatastandard	reviewercomments	Reviewer comments	Referrer	Aldoph Nanguzgambo  Palmerston North Hospital, Midcentral	1. Item 9, is this refering to the mdm chair? If it is, make it simple and just use mdm chair title instead of "Lead health care practitioner". 2. I think question in item16 is not necessary as the core discussion of the lung cancer mdm is centred on discussing radiology imaging PLUS anything else such as histology. I cannot imagine a meeting where you just discuss  histology results without reviewing the radiology. To me, question 16 is irrelevant, at least for the lung mdm.
http://canshare.com/fhir/Questionnaire/mdmdatastandard	reviewerfeedback1	Reviewer comments	Radiology review	Aldoph Nanguzgambo  Palmerston North Hospital, Midcentral	Item 1, is it talking about concordance between the radiology REPORT and the review in the mdm?
http://canshare.com/fhir/Questionnaire/mdmdatastandard	reviewercomments5	Reviewer comments	MDM administration	Aldoph Nanguzgambo  Palmerston North Hospital, Midcentral	Please clarify item 1. Is this referring to whether referral to treating team , eg cardiothoracic surgeons or oncologists has been accepted or declined? Some mdms do NOT generate a referral in the mdm itself but prefer first for the mdm outcome to be discussed with the patient before sending a referral to the appropriate team. This is to avoid sending referrals and then finding that the patient does not want to proceed with that treatment.
http://canshare.com/fhir/Questionnaire/mdmdatastandard	reviewerfeedback1	Reviewer comments	Radiology review	Anthony Lim  HNZ Canterbury	Looks good to me, nice and simple. Free text radiology review field is good as is very situation dependent. Summary of findings can then be included here if relevant. I like the removal of details of the specific imaging studies reviewed, as will sometimes be difficult when multiple studies from different time points are reviewed.
