                    <h4>Welcome to Te Aho o Te Kahu website for Structured Pathology Reporting of Cancer in Aotearoa New Zealand data standards.</h4>
                    <br/>
                    Pathology needs to prepare for a more digital standards-based health data environment.
                    The ever-increasing complexity of cancer treatment requires a greater level of pathology reporting.
                    However the sector is facing major challenges with legacy/paper-based data systems and processes
                    notwithstanding funding issues and increasing workload pressures.
                    <br/> <br/>
                    Pathology is integral to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. So we are working with
                    health care practitioners, pathology providers/vendors to support the transition
                    to an interoperable digital health environment through the development and national
                    adoption of data standards over the coming years.
                    <br/> <br/>
                    Over the coming year Te Aho o Te Kahu will develop Health Information Standards Organisation (HISO)
                    endorsed Pathology Data Standards for all cancers.
                    <br/> <br/>
                    The data standards are displayed in an electronic Form format and layout
                    to aid review only. They are not an implementation form.
                    <br/> <br/>
                    We want to acknowledge the invaluable contributions from health care practitioners, especially
                    our pathologist community, and equity and technical subject matter experts from across the country
                    who are supporting this mahi.
                    <br/> <br/>
                    If you have any general questions please contact <a href="mailto:info@teaho.govt.nz">info@teaho.govt.nz</a>. If want to be actively
                    involved in standard development please contact <a href="mailto:john.manderson@teaho.govt.nz">john.manderson@teaho.govt.nz</a>.

                                <li>give feedback on data standards in development and those published. This can be done at any time to ensure the standards stay relevant for use in clinical practice in Aotearoa.
                                <li>use cancer specific data standards with guidance in reviewing, building and/or updating pathology data systems and associated clinical workflows.
                                <li>use SNOMED CT for pathology clinical terminology and FHIR IG for messaging data.
                                <li>support broader work to improve the shareability of cancer information.
                                <li>seek the latest information on data standard development and release status.

                                We recommend you visit our <a target="_blank" href="https://teaho.govt.nz/about/our-work/pathology">project website</a>

                                and read our <a target="_blank" href="/ds/api/document/preface">Structured Pathology Reporting of Cancer Preface</a>
                                to give you a comprehensive overview of data standards including our approach to develop, publish,
                                and maintain cancer pathology data standards in Aotearoa. This includes the following key points:

                                <ol>
                                    <li>The data standards developed are based on ICCR and adapted by RCPA for use in Aotearoa i.e. we convert the clinical protocol into a technical specification for implementation purposes.
                                    <li>A working group is formed led by Pathologists with support from range of health care practitioners and subject matter experts.
                                    <li>All data standards are submitted to HISO for endorsement once approved by the working group that developed them.
                                    <li>The Form view you see is a visualisation of data elements that should be captured for that cancer:
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>It is used to ensure the data elements are <strong>clinically and technically accurate</strong> using a familiar flow.
                                        <li>It is not an <strong>implemented form</strong> – in fact, when implemented, the data standards will look quite different in your practice/laboratory.
                                    </ol>
                                    <li>The key principle of entering data once and sharing/reusing across multiple systems is fundamental. Full implementation would only be practical if much of the data could be automatically populated via patient and clinical systems to minimise the administrative burden on clinicians and others involved in data entry.
                                    <li>It is not expected all data elements included can be collected immediately and/or are clinically required. This includes balancing structured data capture and free text for more nuisance narrative reporting.
                                    <li>Form Sections <strong>patient details</strong> e.g. NHI etc and <strong>Administration</strong>
                                    e.g. requesting health care practitioner etc are there for <strong>demonstration purposes only</strong> rather than full implementation of required data fields.
                                    <li>The data standards will be continuously monitored and updated according to international best practice, sector feedback and evolving local requirements
                                </ol>

                            There are four categories of standard development:
                            <br/>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Development:</strong> a standard that is actively been developed by the working group so requesting feedback in preparation for submission to HISO for approval.
                                <li><strong>Working draft dataset:</strong> a dataset that is not considered sufficiently robust since it has not been recently updated by international processes and/or insufficient clinical support available to develop.
                                <li><strong>Draft data standard:</strong> a HISO endorsed draft data standard that has been developed from ICCR/RCPA protocols by subject matter experts/clinical representatives. The draft data standard is considered sufficient but requires wider sector review through feedback and/or use in pathology services over a period of up to 12 months.
                                <li><strong>Data standard:</strong> a HISO endorsed finalised data standard where changes have been applied to the draft data standard from feedback through the release period with health care practitioners and subject matter experts confirming it is fit for purpose.
                            </ul>

                                <li>In the top left-hand corner “select standard to view” enables you to search for standards.
                                <li>Click the standard you want to view. Each Standard defaults to the Form view. Clicking each Form heading will cause fields to appear to the side.
                                <li>Hover over <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"></i> and <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down"></i> to get some field definition and rules guidance.
                                <li>At the end of each Form section you can use the feedback boxes (called reviewer comments) to note any particular issues e.g. missing fields, incorrect definitions or values, fields that should be included or general comments.  This can be used during development and when published.
                                <li>Please note many fields do not appear until you choose a relevant value e.g. clinical TNM triggers additional fields to appear. When click “Other”, a free text box appears.
                                <li>When providing feedback enter in your details in the “reviewer details” box (which have a grey background). Once you populate your name and write a comment in a reviewer box the submit button will appear. Only submit when finished.
                                <li>The Home icon appears when leave the front page to return as required.

                                <li>It is not expected all data elements included can be collected immediately and/or are clinically required. This includes balancing structured data capture and free text for more nuisance narrative reporting.

                    <br/><br/>
                    Pathology is integral to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. We are working with pathology services to transition to an interoperable digital health environment through the development of data standards over the coming years.

                    This website provides guidance for anyone looking to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>provide feedback on data standards in development and those published. This can be done at any time to ensure the standards stay relevant for use in clinical practice in Aotearoa.
                        <li>use cancer specific data standards in reviewing, building and/or updating pathology data systems and associated clinical workflows.
                        <li>use SNOMED CT for pathology clinical terminology and FHIR for messaging data.
                        <li>support broader work to improve the shareability of cancer information.
                        <li>seek the latest information on data standard development and release status.
                    </ul>
                    We want to acknowledge the invaluable contributions from health care practitioners, equity and technical SMEs from across the country who are supporting this mahi.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Over the coming months this site will be updated with new standards and additional information including integrating SNOMED CT and FHIR IG support as developed.
